    <h2>Vindinium is a multi-player online game with a goal of collecting the most gold by the end of the game. To get gold, players must conquer gold mines which are guarded and owned by goblins. To get past theses goblins, players must attack and defeat them. Once they have defeated the goblins, the gold mines are under their ownership. Gold mines produce gold for their owners. Players can also attack one another. The victor of this fight gets control over their opponentâ€™s gold mines while the loser keeps all his gold but loses his gold mine.
