        <h2 class="sub-headings">What is a motherboard?</h2>
            <p style="margin-right:500px" class="paragraphs">A motherboard is a printed circuit board including the fundamental and key factors of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be inserted. A motherboard in simpler terms is like the homebase of the computer, where all the hardware components come back together and communicate with each other. A motherboard has many components including back panel connectors and ports, PCI slots, PCI Express x1 slots, a PCI Express x16 slot, a northbridge, a CPU socket, an ATX 12V power connector, front panel USB 2.0 connectors, front panel connectors, an IDE connector, a CMOS battery, a southbridge, SATA connectors, fan headers, RAM slots, an ATX power connector, a mSATA connector, a front panel USB 3.0 connector, and a power and reset button.

        <h3 style="text-align:right;" class="sub-headings">What is a CPU?</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:400px" class="paragraphs">A CPU, central processing unit, is the part of the computer system seen as the "brains" of the computer. The CPU is responsible for carrying out the instructions of a computer program. For example, when you press the letter "h" and it appears on your computer screen, the CPU of your computer makes this action possible. The CPU, located on the motherboard, also has several components including, the arithmetic logic unit  (ALU) which executes the simple mathematics and logical operations, the control unit (CU), which controls the many different components of the computer, and the cache, which is where instructions can be copied to and received.

        <h4 class="sub-headings">What is RAM?</h4>
            <p style="margin-right:400px" class="paragraphs">RAM, random access memory, is known as the computer's memory. It is called random access memory because the data it holds can be accessed at any time, in any order. This is the opposite of the SAM, the serial access memory, whose data can only be accessed in order. The RAM is used to store data for the CPU to process. The data is stored in memory cells which are arranged in grids. When a computer is turned off, all the data in the RAM is lost.

        <h5 style="text-align:right" class="sub-headings">What is a hard-drive?</h5>
            <p style="text-align:right; margin-left:350px" class="paragraphs">A hard-drive is a mechanism used to permanently store and retrieve data. The components of a hard-drive include the head actuator, the read/write actuator arm, the read/write head, the spindle, and the platter. There is also a circuit board on the back of the hard-drive called the disk controller. The disk-controller interprets data sent to and from the hard-drive and tells the hard-drive what to do and how to move the components within the hard-drive. On a traditional hard-drive, all information is stored magnetically.

        <h6 class="sub-headings">How do different components of a computer communicate with each other?</h6>
            <p style="margin-right:400px" class="paragraphs">The different components of a computer communicate with each other by using an interrupt request (IRQ). Each time a component needs the computer's attention, the interrupt controller calls on the CPU to stop what it is doing so that it can process the request. Anything that the CPU was currently doing is put on hold and is stored as a memory address in the memory stack until it is continued by the CPU after the interrupt request is processed.

        <h7 class="subheadings"><strong>What are the keyboard, mouse, and monitor and what do they do?</strong></h7>
            <p style="text-align:right; margin-left:400px" class="paragraphs">The keyboard is the panel of keys that operate the computer. The keyboard allows you to enter information into a computer or any other device. The mouse is an input device that controls the on-screen cursor. The cursor can be moved around the screen by the mouse to select different items on the screen. The monitor is the component of the computer that displays the graphic information developed by the computer. There are two major types of monitors, the LCD and the CRT. CRT monitors are more old-fashioned and obsolete. They are very deep in size whereas the LCD monitors are much thinner, use less energy, and provide higher quality graphics.
