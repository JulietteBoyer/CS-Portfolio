    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>My name is Juliette Boyer. I am fourteen years old and in ninth grade at Summit Shasta High School, home of the black bears. I am a level 10 competitive gymnast and I train at San Mateo Gymnastics in Belmont California. I train twenty four hours per
        week.
        <p>One of my favorite things is architecture. I have always loved designing and creating buildings and houses and would love to carry out my ideas on a bigger, more real scale. One of my goals is to graduate college with a degree in architecture
            or interior design. </p>
            <p>Another one of my favorite things is reading. Growing up, reading was something that was given a high value. My favorite genre to read is science fiction because I find it fascinating and intriguing. One of my favorite books is <em>The Hunger Games</em series. </p>
