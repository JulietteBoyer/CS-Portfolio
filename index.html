        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Juliette Boyer. I am fourteen years old and in ninth grade at Summit Shasta High School, home of the black bears. I am a level 10 competitive gymnast and I train at San Mateo Gymnastics in Belmont California. I train twenty four hours per
        week.
            <p>One of my favorite things is architecture. I have always loved designing and creating buildings and houses and would love to carry out my ideas on a bigger, more real scale. One of my goals is to graduate college with a degree in architecture
            or interior design. </p>
            <p>Another one of my favorite things is reading. Growing up, reading was something that was given a high value. My favorite genre to read is science fiction because I find it fascinating and intriguing. One of my favorite books is <em>The Hunger Games</em> series. </p>
            <p>One of my hobbies is gymnastics. I do gymnastics six days a week, four hours a day. It is not only really fun, but has taught me a lot that I can apply in my actual life as well as in the gym. My goal is to compete gymnastics for a division one college. I don't know what college I'd like to attend yet but some possibilities include, Auburn University, University of Denver, University of Washington, and Arizona State University.</p>
